You can now use MySQL Shell to check out the tables created for the project

# How to run the code
* The first step is to open your IDE and open the 2 python files given in the repostitory which you can get on you local system by Cloning the repository
* The first file is to create a database on which we would be working on
* Just run the "Project Database" python file and a database would be created with sample data for the hotel management system

* When you run the program , you would have to provide your SQL username and password(Note: If you didn't specify a user name then it is "root" by default), please do so!<br>

* Now that our database is created, we can use the other python file for managing the hotel management system database
* Run the other file and you would get a screen asking for your SQL Username and Password. After you fill it you would get the following screen!
